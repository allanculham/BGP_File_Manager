BGP_File_Manager
================

server.php is taken from the Beta 8 release as its feels like a cleaner start point.

The plan for this is to extend the Brigth Game Panel and add a per sever file manager, the only update to the core files
is the extra tab added to server.php.  adding the tab code to any release so far should work.

server.php
----------
This file is updated server details file with the extra file manager tab


filemanagerajax.php
-------------------
Backend file for receiving the ajax actions from the server.php file.


filemanager.php
---------------
Optional standalone page used for the development, accepts serverid param.
